        <p> With the structural damage repaired, the furnishings need to be rehung.  Some banners reflecting words related to Hermes are complete, 
            but others have been faded with time, and some words need to be repainted.</p>
        
            <p>With the temple’s structure restored, you turn to the finishing touches: decorating the altar, arranging offerings, and re-hanging the 
            tattered banners that once hung proudly from the walls. The fabric is faded and frayed, but the symbols of Hermes - winged sandals and 
            the herald’s staff - are still visible beneath the dust. You shake them out carefully, handling each banner as if it holds a sliver of 
            the god’s spirit.
        
            <p>One by one, you lift them up and fasten them along the walls, letting them catch in the gentle breeze that drifts through the temple. 
            Looking carefully at the completed banners, you are able to paint the missing words on the faded banners.
            Each banner, now properly hung, seems to breathe new life into the place. </p>
