        <p>After days of labor, you finally stabilize the floor, laying down new stone and reinforcing the foundation of 
            the crumbling temple. The weight of the work lifts from your shoulders, but just as you catch your breath, Hermes reappears, 
            his grin wider than ever. "Well done, traveler. But there's more to be done."</p>
        <p>You look up to see the towering pillars - once grand and strong - now leaning, cracked, and unstable. "The pillars must be 
            restored next. Without them, the roof will fall, and the temple will remain forgotten forever." </p>
        <p>You swallow, your hands still sore from the floor repairs. "I'm no mason, Hermes." </p>
        <p>"You're a builder of journeys, remember?" Hermes teases, his eyes glinting with divine mischief. "One stone at a time. Repair 
            the pillars, and the temple will rise again - its strength will mirror the faith of the people." </p>
        <p>With a deep breath, you set to work. Each pillar is a challenge, cracked by time and neglect, but you are determined. Slowly, 
            piece by piece, the stones come together, their ancient strength returning with each new layer you add. </p>
        <p>As you work, you remember the story of Hermes' first bit of mischief.
