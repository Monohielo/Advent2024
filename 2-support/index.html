        <p>As Hermes mentions that there's more work to be done, you look up to see the towering pillars - once grand and strong - now 
            leaning, cracked, and unstable. "The pillars must be restored next. Without them, the roof will fall, and the temple will 
            remain forgotten forever." </p>
        <p>You swallow, your hands still sore from the floor repairs. "I'm no mason, Hermes." </p>
        <p>"You're a builder of journeys, remember?" Hermes teases, his eyes glinting with divine mischief. "One stone at a time. Repair 
            the pillars, and the temple will rise again - its strength will mirror the faith of the people." </p>
        <p>With a deep breath, you set to work. Each pillar is a challenge, cracked by time and neglect, but you are determined. Slowly, 
            piece by piece, the stones come together, their ancient strength returning with each new layer you add. </p>
        <p>As you work, you remember the story of Hermes' first bit of mischief.</p>


        <p>It’s a bright day, and little Hermes is born in a cave in Arcadia. His mom is a nymph named Maia and his dad is the mighty Zeus. 
            Hermes may be just a baby, but he can walk, he can talk, and he’s devilishly smart. The first thing he does as soon as he’s out 
            of his mother’s sight is to jump off his crib, sneak out, and go exploring this new world he was born into.  As he leaves the 
            cave, he accidentally kills a tortoise.  Feeling sorry for the creature, he put it in his bag and continues his journey. </p>
        <p>Little Hermes goes to the mountains and finds a herd of cows that belong to his older brother, Apollo. And what does he do? He 
            steals them, of course. Apollo is furious. Who has dared to steal his cattle? It must be an experienced bandit, no doubt. 
            Meanwhile, Hermes is having the time of his life. He has roasted one of the stolen cows over a large fire, he has eaten like a 
            king, and he’s now idly wondering what he could do with the leftovers. </p>
        <p>Suddenly, he has an idea. He takes out the tortoise shell, sticks two horns to it, and stretches seven cow-guts in between. And 
            voila! a stringed instrument, the world’s first lyre! Hermes plays his music and lulls himself to sleep. For his first day out, 
            he couldn’t be more content. </p>
        <p>But Apollo has taken the matter of his stolen cattle very seriously. He goes to Zeus, demanding that the culprit be found and 
            punished. Hermes wakes up to a huge hubbub. Zeus is there, ready to dispense justice. Apollo is there, raving about his cows. 
            Hermes gives them his most innocent smile: “Why are you all yelling and shouting? I’m just a wee baby, did you really think I 
            could do all that? I simply got lost, oh, I’m so glad you found me! Here Apollo, would you like this nice lyre? I made it for 
            you, my favorite brother!” </p>
        <p>And just like that, Apollo’s rage vanishes. Not that he believes the little rascal’s lies, but he can’t help but marvel at the 
            boy’s resourcefulness, he is thoroughly amused by the boy’s nerve, and he really, really digs the lyre - he is the god of 
            music, after all. So he bursts out laughing, hugs little Hermes, and announces that from now on he’ll personally care for him. 
            In exchange for the lyre, he gives Hermes a shepherd’s staff. Apollo will teach him art, music, how to care for animals, and 
            some manners if at all possible. </p>
        <p>Because, if left unchecked, when little Hermes grows up – that infant who tied half of Olympus in a knot on his first day out - 
            he will surely turn the world upside down…</p>
