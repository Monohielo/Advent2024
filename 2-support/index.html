        <p>As Hermes' mentions that there's more work to be done, you look up to see the towering pillars - once grand and strong - now 
            leaning, cracked, and unstable. "The pillars must be restored next. Without them, the roof will fall, and the temple will 
            remain forgotten forever." </p>
        <p>You swallow, your hands still sore from the floor repairs. "I'm no mason, Hermes." </p>
        <p>"You're a builder of journeys, remember?" Hermes teases, his eyes glinting with divine mischief. "One stone at a time. Repair 
            the pillars, and the temple will rise again - its strength will mirror the faith of the people." </p>
        <p>With a deep breath, you set to work. Each pillar is a challenge, cracked by time and neglect, but you are determined. Slowly, 
            piece by piece, the stones come together, their ancient strength returning with each new layer you add. </p>
        <p>As you work, you remember the story of Hermes' first bit of mischief.</p>
