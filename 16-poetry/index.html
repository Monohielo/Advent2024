        <p> Unsure of what you should do next, you look around the clearing and notice that there are several 
            other large rocks.  Even from a distance you can tell that they are important to Athena, but you're not
            sure how.  As you start to walk towards one to get a better look, an owl swoops down from the trees and 
            alights on the stone closest to you, holding another piece of parchment in its beak.
        </p>    
        <p>Approaching respectfully, you can see that this stone has circles of letters carved into it.  You didn't need
            to worry about bothering the owl though; it holds out the parchment to you eargly. Written in precise bold 
            handwriting is a poem honoring Athena.
        </p>

            <p> Reading the poem fills you with awe that the goddess Athena has taken notice you of, and dread that you
                are unsure of what she expects.  The stone must be connected to the poem somehow, but you can't determine
                how. As you stand in clearing, wondering exactly what to do next, the owl shifts on his perch slightly, 
                and knocks a piece of chalk onto the ground. You bend over to replace it, and notice that certain letters
                have been marked with chalk.
