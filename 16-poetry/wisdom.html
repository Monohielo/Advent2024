        <p>Marking off the last letter, you strain your neck to read what remains on the stone.  As you say "wisdom", the owl
            hoots softly, rising into the air, and buffeting your hairs with its wings. You watch the bird soaring gracefully
            above you, knowing you have completed this challenge, wondering if the owl helped you on purpose, or simply
            got restless.  Regardless, you are satisfied you were able to show your worth to Athena, and knowing that
             you have help if you need it makes you confident you will not fail in her nexy task.
