        <p> This time you aren't surprised when you see another owl fly into the clear, circle over your head several times,
            then alight on a stone.  Even from a distance, you can tell this stone is different than the others. With the owl
            hooting gently and dancing atop the stone, you approach to see that there are 6 colorful flowers painted onto it.
        </p>
        <p>You look expectantly at the owl, waiting for it to give you another hint, but you don't see any pieces of parchment
            and the owl isn't giving any clues as to where you should look.  Instead, it just continues doing a little dance.
            As you watch the somewhat awkward movements of its legs, you see that it has 8 colorful beaded bracelets - the same colors
            as the flowers on the stone. Unsure of what to do, you hesitantly ask the owl if you could see the bracelets, and it 
            stops dancing long enough for you to untie them.
