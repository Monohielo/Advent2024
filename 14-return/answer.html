        <p>The battle is long and fierce, but the city’s defenses hold strong, a testament to your planning and Artemis’ 
            blessings. As the last Minotaur falls and the Harpies retreat into the horizon, the townspeople cheer from the 
            citadel walls. The wolves howl in triumph, their voices echoing through the now-still air.</p>
         <p>Artemis appears beside you, her expression proud yet serious. “You have proven that this city is worthy of the 
            gods. It stands because of your courage and wisdom. But remember, peace is earned and must be defended.”
            You nod, feeling the weight of her words. The city has survived, and its people flourish still, stronger and 
            more united than ever.
