        <p> The peace of the newly flourishing city shatters one dawn as horns sound from the citadel. Scouts rush in with 
            grim news: a band of Minotaurs has emerged from the hills, and Harpies circle above, their screeches carrying on 
            the wind. They claim the land as theirs, seeking vengeance for their banishment.</p>
            <p>    You rally the townspeople, guiding them to safety within the citadel while warriors take their positions along 
         the walls. Signal fires flare from the watchtowers, warning of the incoming attack. Artemis' wolves appear from 
            the woods, their eyes glowing with readiness, while the goddess herself watches from a distant hill, testing 
            your strength.
            </p>
