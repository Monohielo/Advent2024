        <p> As the city recovers from the attack, a strange messenger arrives - a sleek owl with eyes like polished bronze. It lands before 
            you, clutching a scroll in its talons. You take it cautiously and unroll it, revealing a message written in elegant, precise 
            handwriting.</p>
        <p>"Theron, your achievements have reached even the heights of Olympus. Yet, skill without wisdom is hollow. I, Athena, goddess 
            of strategy and wisdom, challenge you to prove your mind is as sharp as your hands are skilled. Face my trials, and we shall 
            see if you are truly worthy of the honor you've been granted. Fail, and the world will know your limits."</p>
        <p>The owl fixes you with an expectant gaze before taking flight, leaving you with, among other things, a piece of parchment 
            containing a series of symbols and the unsettling knowledge that Athena herself 
            watches your every move.    
            </p>
        
        <p>Following the further instructions in the note, you head to a clearing near the edge of the city and find a large stone with 
            pictures carved into a grid.  Looking at them more closely, you realize they are the same symbols as the ones on the parchment
            given to you by the owl.
        </p>
