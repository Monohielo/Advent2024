        <p> As the city recovers from the attack, a strange messenger arrives—a sleek owl with eyes like polished bronze. It lands before 
            you, clutching a scroll in its talons. You take it cautiously and unroll it, revealing a message written in elegant, precise 
            handwriting.</p>
        <p>"Mortal, your achievements have reached even the heights of Olympus. Yet, skill without wisdom is hollow. I, Athena, goddess 
            of strategy and wisdom, challenge you to prove your mind is as sharp as your hands are skilled. Face my trials, and we shall 
            see if you are truly worthy of the honor you’ve been granted. Fail, and the world will know your limits."</p>
        <p>The owl fixes you with an expectant gaze before taking flight, leaving you with the unsettling knowledge that Athena herself 
            watches your every move. The first challenge awaits in the clearing near the edge of the city.    
            </p>
