        <p> As the first few travelers arrive, drawn by news of the newly restored temple, you feel a swell of pride and relief. They look around 
            with reverence, marveling at the banners, the altar, and the carved constellations overhead. But just as they begin to approach, a shadow 
            sweeps over the temple entrance, followed by a sudden, ominous silence.</p>

         <p>From the nearby grove, 2 creatures emerge - half human, half horse - eyes gleaming with intelligence and malice. You’ve heard about these 
            vicious creatures before, but you have never seen them.  The travelers cry out, stumbling back as the centaurs ready themselves to attack.
            Your heart pounds, but Hermes’ presence steadies you. This temple is under his protection, and you have rebuilt it with your own hands. </p>

        <p>Gritting your teeth, you reach for a heavy staff left by the altar — a symbol of the god himself — and stand between the creatures and the 
            frightened travelers.</p>

        <p>Summoning all your courage, you raise the staff and shout, invoking Hermes’ name. To your surprise, the staff crackles with a faint, 
            golden light, humming with divine power. The creatures hesitate, their eyes narrowing. As you run to face the beasts, emboldened as you
        are with Hermes' help, you are still thankful that another worshipper is joining the fight along with you.</p>
