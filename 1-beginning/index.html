        <p>As a restless adventurer from the hills of Delphi, you were accustomed to wandering through the forgotten corners of Greece, chasing the 
            thrill of unknown ruins. But one evening, as you camp beneath the stars, a voice echoed in the air - smooth and playful, like the wind 
            itself. It was Hermes. </p> 

        <p>"Theron," the god of travelers called, appearing as a shadowy figure with winged sandals. "I have a task for you. A temple of mine, long 
            neglected in the hills of Arcadia, lies in ruins. It must be rebuilt - not with stone alone, but with the spirit of the people. Bring 
            the faith of the old ways back to life." Intrigued but uncertain, you hesitated. "Why me, god of thieves and merchants? I am no builder." 
            Hermes grinned, his eyes twinkling. "Because, my friend, you are a master of journeys. And this will be your greatest one yet. Find the 
            people, restore the faith, and the temple will rise again." </p> 
        
        <p> With a nod, you set off, the weight of the god's command heavy on your shoulders, yet your heart stirs with a spark of adventure. </p> 
        
        <p> As you approach the temple, you see that it's going to require quite a lot of work. You set about assessing the damage and realize 
            immediately that you're going to need to fix the foundation before anything else. </p> 
        
        <p> There is structural damage on part of the floor that has a mosaic design. Certain tiles will need to be removed to reveal and repair 
            the damage. </p>
