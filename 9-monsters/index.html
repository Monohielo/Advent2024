        <p> Artemis leads you to the edge of the wild lands, where she speaks of the first step in building her sanctuary: clearing the land of 
            dangerous creatures that threaten balance and life. These are no ordinary beasts but ancient terrors of myth—creatures born of chaos and fury.
        <p>“This place will never thrive with such threats lurking,” Artemis says, her silver bow glinting in the soft light. “Echidna dwells 
            deep in the cliffs, the Hydra poisons the rivers, Griffins infest the forest, a Leon terrorizes the fields, the Manticore corrupts the mountain, 
            Sirens claim the shores, and Harpies taint the skies. These creatures are formidable, but they are not invincible. You will not face them alone.”</p>
         <p>With a sharp whistle, she summons a pack of great wolves, their silver coats shimmering like moonlight. “They will guide and help you,” she 
            says, placing a hand on your shoulder. “But the fight is yours. Prove yourself again, and these lands will be free.”
            </p>
