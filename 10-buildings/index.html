        <p> With the land cleared, you stand with Artemis atop a hill overlooking the future city. The landscape stretches out before 
            you, wild yet full of potential. Artemis speaks, her voice steady and sure. "This city must honor the balance between 
            nature and civilization. It will be a sanctuaryâ€”but it must also be a fortress, ready to defend itself against those who 
            would destroy it."</p>
        <p> You nod, sketching the layout in the dirt at your feet. Defensibility is key, and the natural terrain offers the first 
            advantage. Rolling hills, rocky outcrops, and dense forests will serve as barriers, shaping the city's perimeter. You and 
            Artemis discuss every detail, ensuring the city will be both a haven and a stronghold.</p>
        <p>Combining your knowledge, you and Artemis know that the best arrangement of the buildings is to ensure that no one column 
            or row has a building of the same height. To ensure this fact, you mark out a plan of the city that shows how many towers 
            will be visible from each location around the city center.
