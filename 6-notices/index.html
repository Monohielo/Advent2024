        <p> You feel a sense of accomplishment as you survey the completed temple, but Hermes isn't done with you yet.  With a flash, he suddenly
            appears next to you. He hands you scrolls sealed with his signature caduceus, which shimmered with magic. "With the temple restored,
            we'll need to spread the word to those in the surrounding towns. Post these notices where they'll most likely to be seen - by the 
            marketplace, near the gates, and along the roads. Make sure people know the temple is open once again for those seeking guidance 
            on their journeys." </p>

          <p>  "What kind of message is this?" you ask, unrolling a scroll. Hermes chuckles. "Ah, you're clever - you'll figure it out! Just remind 
            the people that the gods are watching over them, and that I'm always ready with a bit of advice or a quick delivery, should they need it." </p>
            
           <p>With a wink, he vanishes, leaving behind a breeze that swirled the papers in your hands.   </p>
