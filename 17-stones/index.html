        <p> The owl does several more loops above the clearing, before flying off.  It flies into the distance as other owl swoops into
            the clearing 
            holding a piece of parchment and settles on another stone looking at you expectantly.
            Following the owl's lead, you walk over to a large stone that has several circles carved into the surface. You notice that 
            there are small stone pieces that look like they might fit into the holes in the large stone.
        </p>

        <p>The parchment held by this owl describes the time a young girl named Arachne challenged Athena to a weaving contest.
            Although she wove beautiful tapestries showing events from the lives of the 
            gods, she stood no chance against Athena who used the sunlight and starlight to create a tapestry that
            depicted the creation of the world.
