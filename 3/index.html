        <p>After the pillars stand firm once again, their ancient strength restored, you step back to survey your work. The temple feels sturdier, 
            its bones steady. But the next task awaits: the mosaic. Once a masterpiece, the wall now stands bare, its colorful tiles long lost to 
            time and weather. </p>
        <p>Hermes materializes beside you, his voice light but laced with purpose. “The walls of this temple were once a place of reverence, a 
            picture of the gods' grace. But now, they're empty. It's your turn to rebuild the mosaic, piece by piece.”</p>
        <p>You gaze at the empty space - smooth stone where intricate tiles should be. "I've no skill for such delicate work, Hermes." </p>
        <p>He chuckles, a soft, musical sound. "You've already restored the foundation, and the pillars. Why not the picture too? The work is slow, 
            but each tile you lay brings the temple closer to its former glory. It's not just stone and tile, it's faith in action. With every 
            piece, the people will begin to remember." </p>
        <p>With a deep breath, you begin. The tiles are scattered in a jumble of faded glass. Each one 
            is imperfect, but as you fit them together, the image slowly re-emerges - a symbol of Hermes, vibrant and whole once more. It's 
            tedious, painstaking work, but you feel the temple coming alive in your hands, each tile a silent prayer to those who once worshiped here. </p>
        <p>By the time you finish, the mosaic gleams in the dim light, a testament to the patience of the gods - and of you. The temple stands not 
            just as a structure, but as a story, pieced together from forgotten fragments.</p>
