        <p> Days after the battle at the temple, word spreads beyond mortal ears and into the realm of the gods. You sense the growing attention, 
            a silent ripple in the air, as if unseen eyes have turned toward you, appraising. You think little of it at first, focusing instead 
            on welcoming new visitors and maintaining the temple. But one evening, as the last rays of sunlight fade over the hills, a new 
            presence fills the air - strong and calm, like moonlight glinting on the surface of a quiet lake.</p>

        <p> Before you stands Artemis, goddess of the hunt and protector of the wild. Her eyes are sharp, yet there's warmth in her gaze. She 
            appraises you quietly, her bow slung over her shoulder, a silver crown gleaming faintly atop her brow.</p>
        <p>"You have done a great honor for Hermes," she says, her voice soft but commanding. "And your skills in rebuilding the temple have 
            not gone unnoticed." She gestures to the land beyond the temple, vast and untamed. "I have need of someone like you. I am planning 
            a city - a sanctuary nestled within nature, a place of balance and beauty."</p>
        <p>The weight of her words settles over you. To build a city, and for the goddess Artemis, no less - this is an honor, a calling, 
            perhaps even a test. You nod, feeling your heart race with excitement and a hint of trepidation.</p>
        <p>Artemis steps forward, laying a hand on your shoulder. "Then we shall begin. There is much work to be done. A city of nature and 
            peace, where the wild and the civilized live side by side - such a place must be carefully woven."</p>
        <p>As she withdraws, you feel her blessing settle over you like a mantle. Together, you will plan and build a city worthy of the gods, 
            a place where nature and humankind will meet in harmony.</p>
